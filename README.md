# Advanced Steel Surface Defect Detection using U-Net++ and ResUNet

This repository contains the implementation of **deep learning models for automatic steel surface defect detection and classification**. The project leverages **U-Net++** and **ResUNet** architectures to identify and classify defects in steel sheet images into four categories:

* **Scratches**
* **Patches**
* **Inclusions**
* **Pits**

## 🚀 Project Overview

Steel is a critical material in construction and manufacturing, where defects can lead to severe structural and functional issues. Manual inspection is often slow, error-prone, and inconsistent. This project automates the defect detection process, improving **accuracy, efficiency, and scalability**.

* **U-Net++**: Provides improved feature representation, precise localization of small defects, and robustness against complex backgrounds.
* **ResUNet**: Combines residual learning with semantic segmentation for better gradient flow, deeper feature extraction, and enhanced edge detection.

## 📊 Key Features

* Automatic detection and segmentation of steel surface defects
* Classification into four major defect types
* Improved performance using **deep learning architectures** tailored for industrial inspection
* Scalable approach suitable for **large datasets**
* Comparative insights into the strengths and trade-offs between U-Net++ and ResUNet
